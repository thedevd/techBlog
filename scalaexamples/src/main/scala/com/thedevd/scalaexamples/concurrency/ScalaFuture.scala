/*
 * scala.concurrent.Future is used to write asynchronous non-blocking operation in scala.
 * A very normal usecase would be calling a webservice or executing a long running task and
 * you want to run it separately from main thread.
 *
 * Creating Future is so simple, you just need to put the block of code in Future Constructor
 * that you want to run off the main thread
 *     Future { //code blocks here
 *              // return some value }
 *
 * Few things to know about Future
 * ##################################
 * 1. Future is used to run tasks off of the main thread.
 * 2. A Futures run immediately after you create it.
 *    (So it is not like java thread where you have to call start() method to run the task)
 * 3. The value in a Future is always an instance of one of the Try types: Success or Failure.
 *       3.a When a Future is completed with a value, we say that the future was successfully completed with that value.
         3.b When a Future is completed with an exception thrown by the computation, we say that 
             the Future was failed with that exception.
 * 4. onComplete() or other callback methods (onSuccess, onFailure) are used to process future's result
 *    when it is available. Means what to do with future'result is decided in callback.
 * 5. Use for-comprehension, if you want to combine results of more than one future to produce single result.
 *
 * so overall -
 * Common callback methods
 *   -- onComplete
 *   -- onSuccess
 *   -- onFailure
 *
 * Note - Import 'import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global' is needed to create Future task,
 * because internally implemented apply method of Future takes ExecutionContenxt type parameter.
 *             Future { ... }(executionContext)   
 *                   OR in more general way-
 *             import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global 
 *             Future {...}
 *             
 * What is ExecutionContext
 * ###########################
 * Future and Promises revolve around ExecutionContexts, which is responsible for executing computations.
 * An ExecutionContext is similar to an Executor: it executes computations in a new thread/pooled thread.
 * The scala.concurrent package comes out of the box with an ExecutionContext implementation, a global static thread pool.
 * import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global is used to import global static thread pool.
 *             
 * A Future has an important property that it may only be assigned once. Once a Future object is given a value or an exception, 
 * it becomes immutableâ€“ it can never be overwritten.
 *
