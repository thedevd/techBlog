/*
 * 1. Accumulators are another type of shared variables in spark that are used to
 *    perform write operations like counters and sum operations across workers nodes.
 *
 *    One of the most common use of Accumulator is count particular events that may help in debugging process.
 * 2. Accumulator are write-only variables for executors. 
 *    They can be added to by executors and read by the driver only.
 * 
 * 3. Accumulator is created using 
 *    sparkContext.longAccumulator() or sparkContext.doubleAccumulator() or sparkContext.collectionAccumulator()
 * 4. Accumulator is updated using add() method
 * 5. At drive, value() is used to read the final value.
 *
 * For ex: we have input file /sparksql/accumulator.txt consisting blank lines which we want to count.

     * 
     * Why this did not work, because driver sends copy of counter variable to each worker node.
     * And each worker node updates thier local copy of it. And updated value of variable never
     * sends back to driver, that is the reason counter value becomes still 0 at driver side.
